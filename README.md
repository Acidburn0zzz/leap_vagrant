This repository contains *minimal* Debian vagrant definitions.

That means a base installation, with no puppet, chef, ruby, ruby gems or 
libraries. 

The installer used is the latest version of the installer and after
the system has been installed, the packages have been updated to the
latest version at the time the system was built.
